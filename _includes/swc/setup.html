<h3>SSH</h3>

All students should have an SSH client installed.
SSH is a tool that allows us to connect to and use a remote computer as our own.
Please follow the directions below to install an SSH client for your system.

<h5>Windows</h5>

Install MobaXterm from <a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net">http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net</a>.
You will want to get the Home edition (Installer edition).

</h5>macOS</h5>

Although macOS comes with SSH pre-installed, you will need to install <a href="https://www.xquartz.org">XQuartz</a> to enable graphical support.
Note that you must restart your computer to complete the installation.

</h5>Linux</h5>

Linux users do not need to install anything, you should be set!
